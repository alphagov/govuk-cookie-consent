        <p class="govuk-body">If you have a Google account and have turned on ‘ad personalisation’, anonymised data about your age, gender and interests may be included in aggregated reports we see in Google Analytics.

                not storing or logging IP addresses in Google Analytics

            <li>
                send email alerts to users who request them

            <li>
                monitor the performance of the site to identify inefficiencies and JavaScript errors
            </li>
        </ul>

        
        <p class="govuk-body">We use the information we collect through Google Analytics and SpeedCurve RUM to see how you use GOV.UK and to see how well the site performs on your device.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">We do this to help:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
                make sure GOV.UK is meeting the needs of its users

                make improvements, for example <a href="#" class="govuk-link">improving site search</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                make performance improvements, for example improving page load time and data usage

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we do with your data</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">The data we collect may be shared with other government departments, agencies and organisations. It may also be shared with our technology suppliers, for example our hosting provider.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">We will share your data if we are required to do so by law - for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The data we collect with Google Analytics cookies is transferred and stored with Google where we analyse it with Google Analytics software (GA4). We do not allow Google to use or share this data for their own purposes.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">We will not:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

                share your data with third parties for marketing purposes
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we keep your data</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">We will only retain your personal data for as long as it is needed for the purposes set out in this document or for as long as the law requires us to.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We will:</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Our services are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children 13 years of age or younger. We do not intentionally collect or maintain data about anyone under the age of 13.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where your data is processed and stored</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at all stages, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">All personal data is stored in the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">European Economic Area</a>(EEA). Data collected by Google Analytics and SpeedCurve RUM may be transferred outside the EEA for processing.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Where data processing happens in the US, suppliers need to meet the certification standards set out in the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">UK-US data bridge</a> agreement. This facilitates flows of personal data to certified US companies that have opted in to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we protect your data and keep it secure</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your data - for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your rights</h2>
